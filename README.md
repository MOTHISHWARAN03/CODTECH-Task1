Overview of the Code
This Python script is designed for data preprocessing using Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools and techniques. It prepares a dataset for machine learning models by addressing common preprocessing steps. Below is a detailed breakdown of the code:

1. Library Imports

The code imports several key libraries:
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
sklearn modules:
train_test_split: Splits data into training and testing sets.
StandardScaler: Standardizes features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.
SimpleImputer: Handles missing values in the dataset.
google.colab.files: Allows manual dataset uploads in Google Colab.

2. Upload Dataset

The script prompts the user to upload a dataset (.csv file) via Google Colab's interface.
The filename is extracted from the uploaded file for further processing.

3. Load Dataset
The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.
An initial overview of the data is displayed using:
head(): Prints the first few rows of the dataset.
columns: Lists the dataset's column names.

4. Handle Missing Values
Numerical columns:
Identified using select_dtypes (data types: float64 and int64).
Missing values are filled with the mean of the respective column using SimpleImputer(strategy='mean').
Categorical columns:
Identified as columns with object type.
Missing values are filled with the most frequent value using
SimpleImputer(strategy='most_frequent').

5. Encode Categorical Variables
One-Hot Encoding:
Converts categorical variables into binary indicators.
Drops the first column for each categorical feature to avoid multicollinearity (drop_first=True).

6. Scale Features
Feature scaling:
Numerical columns are standardized using StandardScaler, which scales values to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

7. Split Data into Features and Target
Features (X):
All columns except the target column.
Target (y):
Specified as age in this script (should be replaced with the actual target column name from the dataset).

8. Train-Test Split
The dataset is split into training and testing subsets using train_test_split with:
test_size=0.2: 20% of the data is used for testing.
random_state=42: Ensures reproducibility of the split.

9. Final Outputs
Confirms that preprocessing is complete.
Displays the sizes of the training and test sets for verification.

Key Highlights
Scalability: Works for datasets with numerical and categorical features.
Flexibility: Easily customizable for different target columns and datasets.
Colab-Friendly: Designed to run interactively in Google Colab.
This script effectively prepares data for machine learning, ensuring clean, standardized, and well-structured input for model training.
